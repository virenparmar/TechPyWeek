# Program to perform different set operations like in mathematics

# define three sets

E={0,2,4,6,8}
N={1,2,3,4,5}

#set union
print("union of E and N is=",E|N)

#set itersection
print("itersection of E and N is=",E & N)

#set difference
print("difference pf E and N is=",E-N)

#set symmetric difference
print("symmetric difference of E and N is=",E^N)
